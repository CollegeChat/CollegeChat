## Overview
### Description
CollegeChat is a social networking application for college students and instructors. Each college will have all offered classes listed on the main page. Students will have access to their designated classes. College admin has the power to monitor all the group chats and posts. Students can have smoother communication with their instructors. Since everything is in distance learning, this application will increase the collaboration between students and instructors.
